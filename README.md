The initial browsing experience on this GitPage might be less than optimal as image downloads could take some time. Please activate caching and refresh the page once, and you'll be treated to delightful desserts and engaging animations. I am in the process of deploying it on Google Cloud Run to enhance the overall user experience.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
